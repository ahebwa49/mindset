          <p>
            MindSet aims to get the young people in Uganda exposed to digital
            skills and to encourage them to dive more into tech related careers.
            Currently, the education system in Uganda is traditional and the
            curriculum in most schools do not take into consideration the tech
            revolution thatâ€™s going on globally. To change this, we are bringing
            tech into the classrooms by offering co curricular programs in
            schools and out of school to empower the youth with digital literacy
            and entrepreneurship skills in bid to encourage innovation,
            creativity and to get a headstart into the future with these skills.
